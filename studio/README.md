**`/schemas`**
    - Most of the work happens by adding/editing json schemas in this directory that define documents and content for the content graph.
    - You can add new json files for new documents or edit existing documents, adding or changing the fields available to edit.
    - [Documentation for schema/data types in Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/docs/schema-types)

**`/schemas/schema.js`**
    - This file exports all the schemas, making them available in the content graph and CMS GUI application.
    - If you add new schemas or rename schemas make sure you update this file.

**`src/deskStructure.js`**
    - Where you can add elements to the CMS GUI for content creators to navigate to and edit documents and content.
    - You should only need to edit this if you're adding new document types.

**`sanity.json`**
    - Configuration for Sanity.
