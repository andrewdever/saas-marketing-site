#### Adding Gatsby Plugins

2. Add plugin to `gatsby-config.js`
  - For some plugins the order matters; I.e., if a plugin is dependant on another plugin that needs to be loaded first.
  - Customize plugin options as necessary.

See [Gatsby's Plugin Library](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins). You can also roll your own [local plugins](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/creating-a-local-plugin/).
